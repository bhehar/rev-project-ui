1. I'm working with Claude code to review my project. I've asked it to quiz me and it's questions are leading me to see improvements I could make. One such improvement is in my Dropdown where I'm creating the drop down items by repeating a similar line of code for each of the role. While this isn't a big deal for three roles, this will grow cumbersome as roles grow. So I'm going to iterate over a list or an object to programatically generate the Dropdown.Items. Doing so will serve the DRY (don't repeat yourself) software engineering principle.
